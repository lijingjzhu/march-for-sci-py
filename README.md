# PDX March of Science: Introduction to Python

Welcome to Python! We hope that the materials and the content you find here
will be helpful to you on your journey in coding. 

#### Why Python?
1. Python is simple - it looks like English! 
2. Python is used by scientists of all kinds - for example, the recent famous picture of the black hole was created using Python. 
3. Python is flexible: you can do pretty much whatever you want except for build phone apps with it. Once you start learning, there's 
4. packages

#### Instructors
Your instructors are all data people at Cascade Data Labs, a local boutique data consulting firm. None of us have official degrees in computer science, which we like to think helps show that the barrier to entry for coding isn't as scary as you might think!

##### Sam Hoffman 
Sam is a data analyst at Cascade Data Labs. She studied Statistics and Turkish in college and is very excited to spread code literacy! Hit her up on Twitter [@upwards_graph](https://twitter.com/upwards_graph).

##### Drew Mahler
Drew is also a data analyst at Cascade Data Labs. He studied biomedical engineering in college and believes anyone can learn to code! Email him with questions at andrew.h.mahler at gmail dot com. 

##### Julie Zhu
Julie is a data scientist at Cascade Data Labs. She studied applied math in college and has a master's degree in statistics, and she really likes pie (she also believes in your ability to code). You can't contact Julie. 

#### Class Agenda
3:30 - 3:45PM Introductions, overview, and intro to Python (Sam) <br>
3:45 - 4:05PM Live Code / Demo (Julie) <br>
4:05 - 4:15PM Final Questions and Wrap-up (Drew) <br>

#### The Online Python Interpreter
We'll be using this online Python interpreter, so that you don't have to spend any class time downloading Python: <br>

However, if you want to download Python after the class, there's a guide [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### Additional Resources

#### Free Online Courses:
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python <br>
Teaches foundational programming skills with Python 2.

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line <br>
Teaches you to work with the command line (for Linux and Mac operating systems). This will help you feel comfortable writing and deploying code on your computer. 

https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/ <br>
To get the Linux/Mac command line on Windows, install the program bash (AKA bourne-again shell).


#### Reference Books

https://automatetheboringstuff.com<br>
Free samples of the book on the website, and a lot of great projects within it.

#### Projects
https://github.com/karan/Projects<br>
The Numbers section has ideas for some fairly quick code to write.

#### Practice

#### Miscellaneous information
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/313254/how-does-the-python-runtime-actually-work <br>
Great post explaining what happens when you run Python code. A lot of fancy terms, but pretty much all of them are on wikipedia!

These are thorough answers to the question "What is code?!?!"
