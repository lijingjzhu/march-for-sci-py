# PDX March of Science: Introduction to Python

Welcome to Python! We hope that the materials and the content you find here
will be helpful to you on your journey in coding. 

#### Instructors
Your instructors are all data people at Cascade Data Labs, a local boutique data consulting firm. None of us have official degrees in computer science, which we like to think helps show that the barrier to entry for coding isn't as scary as you might think!

##### Sam Hoffman 
Sam is a data analyst at Cascade Data Labs. She studied Statistics and Turkish in college and is very excited to spread code literacy! Hit her up on Twitter [@upwards_graph](https://twitter.com/upwards_graph).

##### Drew Mahler
Drew is also a data analyst at Cascade Data Labs. He studied biomedical engineering in college and believes anyone can learn to code! Email him with questions at andrew.h.mahler at gmail dot com. 

##### Julie Zhu
Julie is a data scientist at Cascade Data Labs. She studied applied math in college and has a master's degree in statistics, and she really likes pie (she also believes in your ability to code). You can't contact Julie. 

#### Class Agenda
3:30 - 3:40PM Introductions and Overview of Class <br>

#### The Online Python Interpreter
We'll be using this online Python interpreter, so that you don't have to spend any class time downloading Python: <br>
